# Full Repair Experiment

All the patches generated by sharpFix can be found in `./patch`.

All the candidates used by sharpFix for producing the plausible patches can be found in `./candidate`.

The repair information for each bug for which sharpFix produced a plausible patch can be found in the csv file. At each line, from left to right, it shows the bug id, whether it is plausible (since we only show all the bugs for which sharpFix generated plausible patches, all the rows in this column are TRUE), whether it is correct, the running time (in minutes) for find the patch, the rank of the candidate used for producing the patch, and the number of patches tested before finding the patch.
